# Overview
MapReduce was a seminal paper in distributed systems. It's become a standard
framework for various world-class and world-impact technologies (Hadoop; various
other Apache things I'm not too clear on).

It's become an excellent teaching tool (see 6.824 link below). I've made a few
attempts at doing the linked 6.824 lab, which is in Go, and very much enjoyed
it.

This is a C++ implementation of MapReduce; C++ was the original implementation
language, as described in the paper.
