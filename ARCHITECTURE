Following advice from https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html

Base directories are intended to be as (hopefully) self-explanatory as possible.

`compute`
	Process data and perform actions with the computer.

	- mapreduce: Parallel processing of key-value data.

`storage`
	Representations of data. Various use cases and API interfaces.

	- bigtable: Distributed data table system.
	- chubby: Lock and key system.
	- gfs: Abstraction of a distributed file system.
	- sstable: Basic atomic file format, as efficient sorted string key-value chunks.

`utils`
	Miscellaneously useful tools.

	- error_handling: Interface of errors and statuses of operations.
	- gcl: Generic config language for binaries.
	- parser: Parse streams of data (usually text) into client-defined chunks.
